    <p>
      My name is Noriko.
      I am a furniture designer/CAD operator designing outdoor patio furniture.
      I've started taking courses for UX design and decided I might consider a
      career change from Physical Product Design to Digital Product Design.
      I recently bought a MacBookPro and I am still trying to get used to it.

      For the most part I was able to install Atom, Node.js and Git following the instructions
      while watching the video without any problem. I had the biggest problem installing
      Grunt.  I followed the instructions typing the command in the Terminal but,
      when it showed a list of errors, I panicked. I tried a few times before trying
      the sudo command which gave me warnings.
      I thought this was also an error and posted the issue on the discussion
      board where I got help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finally got the project to publish!
      I followed the instructions in the video and somehow got the project published but,
      I do not fully understand the reasons to why things work the way they do.
      Hopefully I will have better understanding as I learn more during the semester...
